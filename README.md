# Project-2

### Intro
This is the repository for the ETL mini project (Project 2). In this repository, we (Alex H. and Ryan U.) display our proficiency with extracting, transforming, and loading data using python knowledge and an SQL database. 

Our main code can be found in the "ETL_Mini_Project_AHamilton_RUrabe.ipynb" file. The excel worksheet outputs, ERD, and SQL query can be found in the "Resources" folder.


### The Process:




Data Extraction and Transformation: Python

Data Import and Extraction: 

Utilized Pandas library to import contact information from an Excel file.
Extracted relevant details from the "contact_info" column using JSON decoding.
Data Transformation and Cleaning:

Split full names into first and last names, enhancing data structure.
Organized extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Database Design and Management: SQL

Database Schema Design:

Developed a well-structured database schema using SQL.
Defined primary keys and appropriate data types for each table.
Data Integrity and Relationships:

Established essential foreign key constraints to ensure data accuracy.
Ensured a seamless connection between tables for meaningful analysis.
Data Import and Formatting:

Employed SQL's \copy command to import CSV data into tables.
Overcame data formatting challenges by aligning column order and values.
Data Querying and Exploration:

Practiced SQL querying skills to retrieve specific data.
Employed the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause to filter results.
Data Quality Enhancement:

Adjusted data types for better precision, especially in decimal values.
Conclusion and Next Steps:

Through a collaborative effort of Python and SQL skills, we've crafted a data-driven workflow. Python facilitated efficient data extraction, transformation, and organization, while SQL empowered us to create a structured database, enforce relationships, import data, and extract meaningful insights. With this foundation, we're well-equipped to delve into deeper analysis and uncover valuable insights to inform decision-making.
