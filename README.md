# Project-2

### Category, Subcategory and Campaign DataFrames:


### Contacts Dataframe, ERD, and SQL:





Data Extraction and Transformation: Python

Data Import and Extraction:

Utilized Pandas library to import contact information from an Excel file.
Extracted relevant details from the "contact_info" column using JSON decoding.
Data Transformation and Cleaning:

Split full names into first and last names, enhancing data structure.
Organized extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Database Design and Management: SQL

Database Schema Design:

Developed a well-structured database schema using SQL.
Defined primary keys and appropriate data types for each table.
Data Integrity and Relationships:

Established essential foreign key constraints to ensure data accuracy.
Ensured a seamless connection between tables for meaningful analysis.
Data Import and Formatting:

Employed SQL's \copy command to import CSV data into tables.
Overcame data formatting challenges by aligning column order and values.
Data Querying and Exploration:

Practiced SQL querying skills to retrieve specific data.
Employed the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause to filter results.
Data Quality Enhancement:

Adjusted data types for better precision, especially in decimal values.
Conclusion and Next Steps:

Through a collaborative effort of Python and SQL skills, we've crafted a data-driven workflow. Python facilitated efficient data extraction, transformation, and organization, while SQL empowered us to create a structured database, enforce relationships, import data, and extract meaningful insights. With this foundation, we're well-equipped to delve into deeper analysis and uncover valuable insights to inform decision-making.
